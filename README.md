Questions:
1. I have three test files(testTask1, testTask2, testTask3), each test is for a task. Is such test what you want? 
   Should I also do unit test?
2. For task 3, I wanted to prevent people viewing a business plan if someone else is editing that plan. 
   I don't know how to test it since I don't know how to open two clients at the same time to have two different users logged in.
   For now, I just hard code that a user is editing the plan and see what happens if another user tries to view that plan.
   Is this ok? Or should I do something else?
